## ✦ Architecture Principles

- **MVVM** for separation of concerns (ViewModel controls state)

- **MVI** for predictable state & unidirectional data flow:

  - `Intent` → User actions
  - `ViewModel` handles `Intent`, emits new `UiState`
  - `UiState` → Drives UI
  - `UiEffect` → One-time events (navigation, toasts)
